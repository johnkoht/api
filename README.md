# Personal API

This is a static API right now. One day, perhaps, it will be a full fledge API.

Currently, this powers the build process for my personal website built in Gatsby, source code is [here](https://github.com/johnkoht/website) and site is at [johnkoht.com](https://www.johnkoht.com).


## Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `json-server --watch db.json --port 3100`
