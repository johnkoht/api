    "biography": "<p>Hi, I'm John. I'm a full-stack product leader from Chicago. I founded Kohactive, a digital product agency, in 2008 that was recently acquired by LaunchPad Lab. I'm currently the VP of Client Strategy, where I help organizations through product strategy and development.</p><p>My software adventures started in 1995 when I was twelve years old and discovered AOL. I created punters and scrollers to learn how to code using Visual Basic. I used to create interfaces using Microsoft Paint. I probably annoyed a lot of people with the stupid apps I built. Fast forward to 2007. I started making websites and custom content management systems for some local businesses to help develop their online presence.</p><p>I founded Kohactive with a mission of creating quality software for companies of all sizes. Initially, I acted as a project manager, designer, and front-end developer. Eventually, I moved into backend development, product management, and strategy. Since then, I've helped launch over 200 products for startups, SMBs, and enterprise companies. I enjoy the entire process of product development, from ideation to strategy to execution.</p><p>My core focus is product development. I'm interested in product vision and strategy as well as building implementation teams and processes.</p><p>When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I enjoy various hobbies like photography, tinkering with some IoT/home automation, and working on side projects. I'm a fan of whiskey and have been known to make some delicious cocktails at home.</p>",
